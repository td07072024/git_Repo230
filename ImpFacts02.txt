The cigarette beetle measures between 2 and 3 mm in length, making the cigarette beetle relatively small, and it is dark brown in color. Despite its diminutive size, the cigarette beetle is a significant pest in tobacco related industries for which it gets its namesake. Beyond tobacco, the cigarette beetle will infest most dry goods, including cereals, dried fruits, herbs, flour, and certain animal products.[6]

Geographically, L. serricorne is naturally found in pan-tropical regions, but they have been distributed all over the world through the dried goods trade. The distribution and success of reproduction of the species is heavily tied to their environment. Larvae of the cigarette beetle require temperatures between 15 째C and 40 째C in order to successfully hatch, with the most optimal range for fecundity being between 30 째C and 33 째C. While the cigarette beetle can be found globally, this temperature preference allows the species to thrive best in tropical zones where temperature conditions are most suitable to this ideal range.[7]

The cigarette beetle also has strong flight capability, which contributes to its migration pattern. This ability to move efficiently between infested food sources to uninfested food sources greatly contributes to the species' success as a pest and its geographic range.[8]

The primary food source for this species includes the stored commodities they infest, such as spices, seeds, rice, cereals, and most notably, dried tobacco leaves.[9] The food source of the cigarette beetle significantly influences fecundity, developmental time, survival rates, and body weight. Interestingly, the lowest fecundity was reported with tobacco leaves as a food source, while flour produced the highest fecundity.
