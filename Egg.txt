Lasioderma serricorne eggs are white and opaque when they are first laid, but soon become yellow tinted after hatching. They are oblong in shape, and their length is generally 0.29 to 0.50 mm long with a diameter of 0.18-0.25 mm. An individual egg typically weighs between 8.0 and 9.0 μg.[19]

The pre-oviposition period of L. serricorne ranges from 1 to 5 days. During oviposition, the female beetle will lay between 10 and 100 eggs in the evening or night directly on top of dried food material. The number of eggs laid can depend on the type of substrate they are laid upon.[9] Crowding can cause the female beetle to deposit their mature eggs more quickly, but in general females will reduce the number of eggs they lay when faced with over-population.[20] Eggs will usually hatch 6–8 days after they are laid, and at suitable temperatures egg viability can be up to 100%.
