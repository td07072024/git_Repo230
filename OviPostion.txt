The number of eggs a female cigarette beetle will lay during oviposition varies greatly on the environment the female has to lay eggs on. Typically, a female will lay up to 100 eggs in an evening directly on their food source. Most eggs are laid by a female within 4 days of adult emergence, but females can lay eggs up to 12 days after emerging into adulthood. Most of the time, females will oviposit at or near the site where they themselves had developed. The females and males of the cigarette beetle species do not care for their offspring after oviposition is completed.[16] The rate of oviposition in cigarette beetles is highest at the upper temperature limit for reproduction but decreased sharply at any temperature above this ideal range. The type of substrate the cigarette beetle lays eggs on can impact the number of eggs laid, where lying eggs on rice produced the smallest number of eggs and lying eggs on wheat produced the greatest number of eggs.
