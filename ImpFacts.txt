Lasioderma serricorne, more commonly referred to as the cigarette beetle, cigar beetle, paprika beetle or tobacco beetle, is a small beetle that shares a resemblance with the drugstore beetle (Stegobium paniceum) and the common furniture beetle (Anobium punctatum). The cigarette beetle, along with the drugstore and furniture beetles, all belong to the beetle family Ptinidae. The cigarette beetle can be distinguished from A. punctatum by its flatter thorax, whereas A. punctatum boasts a humped thorax. The cigarette beetle can be further differentiated from S. paniceum by its uniformly serrated antennae with unmodified apex, unlike the three-segmented apical "club" of S. paniceum. Additionally, L. serricorne has no evident grooves in its elytra, or hardened wing covers, compared to A. punctatum and S. paniceum which both have grooves.

In addition to cigarette beetle, other common names for L. serricorne include "tobacco bug", "tobacco borer", "tobacco weevil" and "cheroot beetle".[4] Lastly, another common name for the species is "tow bug", after the species' tendency to feed on upholstery fillings such as tow, hemp, and flax.
