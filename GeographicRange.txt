Lasioderma serricorne are naturally found in pan-tropical areas but can be found anywhere where dried tobacco is stored.[11] The species has been distributed throughout the world by transportation of infested dried goods.[12] Climate is vital to the growth and reproduction of L. serricorne, specifically in terms of temperature. L. serricorne larvae will not hatch below 15 °C or above 40 °C. The longevity and fecundity of adult beetles are also impacted, both of which are significantly reduced at high temperatures. Climates in the 33 °C to 37.5 °C range can significantly decrease the duration of the preoviposition period, while the oviposition period tends to lengthen at this temperature range. The ideal temperature range for maximum fecundity, for cigarette beetles is 30 °C to 33 °C.[7] Thus, the climate that is best suited to this species is the tropical zone, as a significant limitation to their geographic distribution is low temperature.[13]

Lasioderma serricorne are strong fliers, which contributes to their migration patterns. Flying migrant L. serricorne beetles have a significant impact on the species' ability to infest in different agricultural landscapes, which further contributes to the species' wide geographic range.
